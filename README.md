# Robotics-IST-Scorbot
Code to send commands to the Scorbot in serial form. The aim of the project is to read an image in Python and then make the robot draw the same image on a sheet of paper

# Requirements

There is a requirements.txt with all the libraries needed to run the code.

# How to run the code

1. Put the image to be drawn by the robot inside the folder  **PutTheImageHere**

2. Open the terminal in the folder **Robotics-IST-Scorbot** (otherwise Python won't find the path to the image)
Ex: Your terminal has to show something like this "*C:\somePath\Robotics-IST-Scorbot>*"

3. Run (ourMainCode.py) and the robot will draw the image put inside the folder mentioned above (this step is not finished, but you can use the code in *howToObtainList* to obtain the list to give to SCORBOT)
